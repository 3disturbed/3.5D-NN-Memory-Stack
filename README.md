# 3.5D Neural Network Memory Stack

An experimental **3.5D memory substrate** designed for advanced neural network architectures. This library provides tools to manage multi-dimensional memory nodes, integrate with an HTML5 `<canvas>` for visualization, and explore how network topologies can self-adapt through a novel approach to memory allocation and retrieval.

## Overview
This project aims to showcase a **3.5D Memory Stack** concept—somewhere between 3D and 4D—giving neural networks the flexibility of high-dimensional memory while keeping data structures more accessible than pure 4D systems. Think of it as a stepping stone to fully multi-dimensional memory architectures.

1. **Nodes in (x, y, z)**: Each node can store a 2D or multi-dimensional array (XY plane).
2. **Dynamic Expansion**: Memory auto-expands as you write to new coordinates.
3. **Adaptable**: Ideal for research into self-adjusting neural network topologies.
4. **Visualization**: Includes optional `<canvas>` usage for interactive or graphical representations.

## Features
- **3D Addressing**: Store data in `(xx, yy, zz)` format with unlimited node creation.
- **2D Internal Arrays**: Each node contains a matrix or “plane” of values.
- **Auto-Expansion**: Writing to out-of-bounds indices expands the data structure seamlessly.
- **Easy Integration**: Minimal dependencies; can be integrated into existing JS codebases.
- **Canvas Rendering**: Basic optional hooks for visualizing memory access patterns on an HTML5 `<canvas>`.
